# 🧪 Glass Type Classification with Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies machine learning to the **UCI Glass Identification dataset**, which is often used in forensic science.  
The objective is to predict the type of glass found at crime scenes based on its chemical composition.

The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration  
- Visualization of feature distributions  
- Training and evaluation of multiple classification models  
- Comparison of results and ensemble modeling  

---

## 🔬 Key Outcome
Among the tested approaches, a custom **ensemble model** achieved the **best test accuracy of 88.4%**, showing the value of combining classifiers for improved robustness.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `catboost`
